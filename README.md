# itemsDiscount
This file shows functional tests that you would perform in order to automate a webpage. It demonstrates using assertions as wells as implicit and Explicit wait as using timer in situations where you would create a list. Additionally, we use for loops and chaining in order to traverse from Parent function to child. We extract text from items we add into a cart and create lists. We also created empty list to which we appended and created a list to compare expected to actual values. we used for loops to get sum of adding all the items on the list. we also compared the sum displayed to what we expected and added assertions to verify the values matched. We converted the values we extracted from string into integer so the values could be compared.  We verified the discount was applied. we also converted the values into float so the values could be compared as the discount showed a float value. This was created using Selenium, Python PyCharm.
